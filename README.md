# Bike Sales Pivot Dashboard – Excel Project

## 🎯 What I Built
Using a global bike sales dataset, I built an interactive dashboard in Excel to analyze sales patterns. The core of the project was creating a Pivot Table, adding Slicers for dynamic filtering, and generating a Pivot Chart to visualize the findings, all to answer specific business questions from my justIT Data Skills Bootcamp workbook.

## 💡 Key Things I Learnt
- **Pivot Tables**: I learned to structure a Pivot Table to answer complex questions by arranging data across rows, columns, and values.
- **Interactive Slicers**: I implemented slicers for `Country` and `Customer_Gender` which allow a user to easily filter the entire report with a single click.
- **Pivot Charts**: I generated a Pivot Chart directly from my Pivot Table, creating a powerful, dynamic visualization that updates automatically when the data is filtered.
- **Data Exploration**: This project wasn't just about building things; it was about using the tools to explore the data and find the answers to the specific questions in my workbook.

## 🔍 Top Insights (Answers from my Workbook)
| Question | Finding | Business Takeaway |
|---|---|---|
| What are the most profitable markets by country, age group, and gender? | **Adults (35-64) in the United States** generated the most profit across both genders. | This is the most valuable customer segment. Marketing efforts and premium product offers should be heavily focused here. |
| In which product categories does Germany have customers? | Germany has customers in all three categories: **Accessories, Bikes, and Clothing**. | The entire product catalogue is viable in the German market, so all product lines can be promoted there. |
| What country has sales in all product categories? | The **United States, Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom** all have sales across every product category. | These are the most stable and diverse markets, representing the best opportunities for cross-selling products. |

## 🎓 Part of My Bootcamp Journey

## 🤔 If I Had More Time
- I would add a "Calculated Field" to the Pivot Table to calculate the average profit per order, not just the sum.
- I would create a more polished dashboard by arranging the slicers and chart neatly and adding a title.
